# Cafeteria App

## Description
    
The main motive behind making this <b>Cafeteria App</b> was to get rid out of standing in a queue for ordering your Coffee and get it on the table without waiting for a long time and through this app you can select how much spoon sugar you want as well as how much the strength should be of your Coffee.

The thought of making this app came into my mind when i visited my sister's company where she works and i saw huge crowd of employees seeking for a Coffee from the companies Canteen, so this App can be useful for the companies and Organization so that employees can save their time not being in the queue.
